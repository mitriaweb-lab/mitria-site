  "storyHeading": "Started at an elephant sanctuary",
  "storyText1": "Mitria began when two friends working at an elephant sanctuary bonded over a shared passion for ethical tourism and community development. After seeing how many humanitarian projects and highland communities were suffering during covid, we decided it was time to start building a way to support them.",
  "storyText2": "What started as a simple idea to fundraise for people in need grew into a small-but-determined travel company with a healthy dislike for authority and business as usual.",
  "storyText3": "We're deeply inspired by the anarchist lifestyle of the hill tribe communities that we work with and this influences every aspect of how we operate. Mutual aid and the rejection of mass-tourism practices are at the core of who we are. We want to design trips that WE would want to experience. We're dedicated to getting marginalized people more self-sufficient and giving travelers a more authentic experience while doing it.",

  "whatWeDoText": "Our work centers on supporting community-led projects and building travelers' awareness of local social issues while creating meaningful ways for them to help. These projects range from infrastructure and conservation efforts to cultural and education initiatives. The majority of our profit goes directly into funding these projects and organizations so you can rest easy knowing your money is having an impact even after your trip is finished."
