Mitria actively supports the movement toward hands-off elephant tourism and bringing an end to the practice of breeding elephants in captivity. Over the years, we've been lucky to have worked with several projects across Asia and have contributed to captive elephant care through direct hands-on labor as well as financial support.

Our focus also extends beyond elephant welfare to include the wellbeing of mahouts, many of whom come from refugee or marginalized backgrounds and face economic hardship within the traditional tourism model. By promoting responsible, observation-based sanctuaries, we aim to create a future where elephants live with greater freedom and mahouts earn fair livelihoods rooted in respect and compassion rather than exploitation.
