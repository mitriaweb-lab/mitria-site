In the Hmong village of Ban Long Lao, just outside Luang Prabang, we're working with our friend and village chief Kua to support the creation of a new community center that will serve as a hub for cultural preservation and village life.

The center will include a small museum showcasing Hmong traditions, clothing, and crafts, as well as space for meetings, performances, and festivals like Hmong New Year. The existing meeting hall will be transformed into a shop and café run by the village women's union, offering locally made handicrafts and refreshments to visitors. Built collaboratively with volunteers using handmade adobe bricks, the project aims to strengthen community pride, create income opportunities, and celebrate Hmong culture for generations to come.
