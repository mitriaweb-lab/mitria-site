In the Hmong village of Ban Chok, across the Mekong from Luang Prabang, our friend Lue made us aware that access to clean water remains a major challenge, especially during the dry season.

The government previously installed a water system to fix the issue, but heavy limestone sediment quickly clogged the pipes, leaving the community with limited and unfiltered water that must be boiled before drinking. We're partnering with Lue and community leaders to repair and improve the system by installing new filtration units designed to prevent buildup and ensure a steady, safe water supply year-round.
