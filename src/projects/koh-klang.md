On Koh Klang Island, years of coastal erosion and unchecked development have taken a toll on the marine ecosystems that once thrived there. As the shoreline receded, wildlife disappeared, houses had to be moved and livelihoods were erased.

Now, the local community has decided to take restoration into their own hands by replanting mangroves, restoring habitats, raising native bee colonies, and removing rubbish to bring the island's ecosystem back to life. Our friends Mat and Moona, who run a small guesthouse in the community, are leading the charge and organizing as many projects and volunteer groups as they can. We're proud to partner with the residents of Koh Klang and support their work where we can.
