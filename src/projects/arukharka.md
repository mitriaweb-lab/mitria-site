In the Tamang village of Arukharka, 3 hours north of Kathmandu, the local monastery once stood as the heart of community life: a place for prayer, festivals, and rituals marking every stage of life. When it was destroyed in the 2015 earthquake, the village lost more than a building; they lost their cultural and spiritual gathering place.

Since then, our friend Nima Lama and his family, who are entrusted with the stewardship of the monastery, have been using their own funds bolstered by small contributions from the community to slowly rebuild. By working alongside the Lama family to help fund its reconstruction, we hope to ensure that future generations have a space to preserve their traditions and reconnect with their heritage.
