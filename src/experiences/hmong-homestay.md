Step into a Hmong village nestled in the mountains outside of Luang Prabang. After being welcomed by your homestay family, you'll be guided through the community by Mr. Kua, one of the village chiefs. Spend the day learning about Hmong culture and village life: visit the shaman, try traditional instruments, and join an embroidery class led by the local Women's Union.

In the evening, share a dinner of traditional Lao and Hmong food around your hosts' table while learning a little of the local dialect. The next morning, hike with Kua through jungle trails to the breathtaking Kuang Si Falls for a well-earned swim.
