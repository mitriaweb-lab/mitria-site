Try a new form of elephant tourism that benefits the elephants and their caretakers alike. We'll begin in the hills outside of Chiang Mai at a hands-off elephant sanctuary. You'll wander forest trails with your guide as the elephants forage freely in their natural habitat. Here you'll also meet your host: Mr. Cherd, the head elephant caretaker of the sanctuary.

In the afternoon, walk with Cherd to his nearby village and settle into your homestay. Join Cherd and his wife Ki in preparing a traditional Thai-Karen dinner while learning about their lives and culture over shared stories. The next morning, hike to a hidden waterfall and take part in optional cooking and weaving classes before returning to Chiang Mai.
