storyHeading: "Started at an elephant sanctuary"
storyText1: "Mitria began when two friends working at an elephant sanctuary bonded over a shared passion for ethical tourism and community development. After seeing how many humanitarian projects and highland communities were suffering during covid, we decided it was time to start building a way to support them."
storyText2: "What started as a simple idea to fundraise for people in need grew into a small-but-determined travel company with a healthy dislike for authority and business as usual."
storyText3: "We're deeply inspired by the anarchist lifestyle of the hill tribe communities that we work with and this influences every aspect of how we operate. Mutual aid and the rejection of mass-tourism practices are at the core of who we are. We want to design trips that WE would want to experience. We're dedicated to getting marginalized people more self-sufficient and giving travelers a more authentic experience while doing it."

whatWeDoText: "Our work centers on supporting community-led projects and building travelers' awareness of local social issues while creating meaningful ways for them to help. These projects range from infrastructure and conservation efforts to cultural and education initiatives. The majority of our profit goes directly into funding these projects and organizations so you can rest easy knowing your money is having an impact even after your trip is finished."

    <div class="commitment"><h4>No Poverty Tourism</h4><p>Our experiences will always be dignified, consent-based interactions facilitated by community members. Any and all donations are given to community leaders to be distributed as they see fit. We do not allow visitors to give sweets or gifts to local children.</p></div>
    <div class="commitment"><h4>Community-Led Approach</h4><p>Community members decide what's needed and local voices guide all projects, experiences, and funding.</p></div>
    <div class="commitment"><h4>Animal Welfare</h4><p>No riding, bathing, or close-contact with elephants, ever. Same goes for all animals unless the experience is strictly vetted by our team or a third-party organization.</p></div>
    <div class="commitment"><h4>Environmental Consciousness</h4><p>We're committed to low-impact travel, single-use plastic reduction, and always having an emphasis on supporting conservation initiatives.</p></div>
    <div class="commitment"><h4>Local Economy First</h4><p>We prioritize local suppliers, guides, artisans, and skilled workers. You won't be teaching English or doing anything that should be done by a qualified local on our trips.</p></div>
    <div class="commitment"><h4>Genuine Experiences</h4><p>We don't force good feelings by staging community interaction or lying to you about your impact. We're upfront about where your money goes and why.</p></div>
