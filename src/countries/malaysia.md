Malaysia is a meeting place of trade winds, migration routes, and centuries of cultural exchange. Once part of ancient maritime kingdoms and later a prize of colonial powers, it now holds many worlds within one border. In the highland tea fields, on the wooden jetties of fishing villages, and in the call to prayer drifting through tropical rain, Malaysia's history is not locked in museums; it breathes in the everyday.

The peninsula offers Malay, Chinese, and Indian heritage intertwined, while Borneo's wild interior shelters rare wildlife like orangutans, proboscis monkeys, and pygmy elephants.
