Malaysia sits at the crossroads of Malay, Chinese, Indian, and indigenous Orang Asli and Dayak cultures, shaped by centuries of maritime trade and colonial occupation. Borneo's interior holds some of the oldest rainforest on earth, and the communities living there are working to keep it standing. We don't yet have on-the-ground partnerships in Malaysia, but we're building connections with conservation and community organizations in Sabah and Sarawak. Contact us if you're planning travel here and want recommendations.
