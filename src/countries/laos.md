      village chief Kua to build a new community center that will serve as a
      gathering place and a living museum of Hmong culture. The space will host

    description: Across the Mekong from Luang Prabang, in another Hmong village
      called Ban Chok, our friend Lue tells us that clean water is scarce,
      especially during the dry season. We're working with Lue and local leaders
      to restore and upgrade the system with new filters that prevent buildup
      and provide the community with a reliable, clean water supply all year
      long.

travelTips: "Remove shoes before entering homes and temples. Say \"sabaidee\" with a slight bow (nop). Don't touch anyone's head. Don't point your feet at people or sacred objects. Try sticky rice with your hands the way locals do. Support local businesses over foreign-owned ones. Dress modestly at temples and in rural areas."

Laos (pronounced "Lao") drifts at its own pace, following the winding flow of the Mekong and the steady beat of village life. Once known as the "Land of a Million Elephants," Laos is rich in culture and natural beauty, but many communities still face challenges with access to water, education, and sustainable livelihoods. Towns like Vang Vieng were once known as "the Sin City of SE Asia," but the majority of the country has no interest in regaining that reputation. Laos may be too rugged or slow-paced for many travelers, but that's exactly why we love it.
