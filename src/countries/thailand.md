  - name: Koh Klang Island Community Conservation
    location: Krabi
    image: /images/rachael-annabelle-knmjul9t1sa-unsplash.jpg
    description: "On Koh Klang Island, years of erosion and development have damaged
      the coastline and the rich ecosystems that once sustained local life. As
      the sea crept closer, homes, wildlife, and livelihoods were lost. Today,
      the community is leading its own restoration: replanting mangroves,
      rebuilding habitats, raising native bees, and cleaning the island's
      shores. We're proud to support their efforts and partner with our friends
      Mat and Muna to revive the island's environment and protect it long into
      the future."

    description: Mitria is committed to supporting hands-off, ethical elephant
      tourism and ending the cycle of captive breeding across Asia. We've worked
      with multiple sanctuaries, contributing both direct care and financial
      support to improve the lives of elephants in need. Our efforts also focus
      on the wellbeing of mahouts, many from marginalized or refugee
      backgrounds, by promoting sanctuaries that offer fair wages, dignity, and
      humane working conditions.

seasons:
  - name: Cool & Dry (Nov–Feb)
    description: Clear skies, mild temperatures, and vibrant festivals like Loy
      Krathong (lanterns floating on rivers) and Yi Peng (sky lanterns in Chiang
      Mai). Best season for trekking in the north and exploring cultural sites.
  - name: Hot Season (Mar–May)
    description: Warm to very hot, especially in April, but a great time for fruit
      harvests and the exuberant Songkran water festival (Thai New Year).
  - name: Green Season (Jun–Oct)
    description: Afternoon rains turn landscapes lush, rivers swell, and fewer
      tourists mean quieter villages. Great for photography and cultural
      immersion.
travelTips: "Greet with a \"wai\" (palms together, slight bow). Never touch someone's head or point feet at people or images of Buddha. Stand during the royal anthem in cinemas and public events. Remove shoes before entering homes and temples. Cover shoulders and knees at temples. Try street food; it's often better than restaurants."

Thailand is woven from ancient kingdoms, distinct cultures, and modern rhythms. Monks sweep temple grounds at dawn while bustling streets pulse with urban life. In the rural highlands, the new generations seamlessly blend ethnic traditions with the latest Tik Tok trends. It's almost impossible to step where no tourist has tread before here, but there's also never been a better ability to connect and contribute in positive ways.
