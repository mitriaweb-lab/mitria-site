Vietnam's story runs like its rivers: winding through dynasties, colonial rule, and hard-fought independence. Rice paddies mirror the sky, and cities hum with a determined energy born from rebuilding and remembering. In the alleys of Hanoi's Old Quarter or the lantern-lit streets of Hội An, history is not just preserved; it's lived, layered into the cadence of daily life.

The highlands are home to ethnic minority groups such as the Hmong, Dao, and Tay, while the coast offers fishing villages, limestone islands, and bustling markets.
