travelTips: "Learn to say \"xin chào\" (hello) and \"cảm ơn\" (thank you). Cross busy streets by walking steadily; don't stop or run. Remove shoes when entering homes. Dress modestly at temples and pagodas. Bargain respectfully in markets but not in shops with fixed prices. Try phở for breakfast like locals do. Accept tea when offered; it's a sign of hospitality."

Vietnam stretches from the terraced highlands of the north to the river deltas of the south, with 54 recognized ethnic groups, a complex colonial and wartime history, and cities that move at a pace that takes getting used to. We don't currently run experiences or projects in Vietnam, but we're exploring partnerships with community organizations in the northern highlands and central coast. If you're planning travel here, get in touch and we can connect you with organizations doing good work.
