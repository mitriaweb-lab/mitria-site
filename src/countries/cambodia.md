    description: In 2007, the Elephant Valley Project was launched as an elephant
      sanctuary developed to create a home for injured and overworked elephants
      and is now a centerpiece for elephant conservation, which is located
      within Putrom's community land. ELIE is unique in terms of its primary
      source of funding, which comes directly from donations made by local and
      international visitors to the EVP. Since 2006 the NGO has evolved and
      grown, with the development of the EVP as a tourist attraction, providing
      a sustainable financing mechanism for funding all ELIE programs.

  local foods like amok and bamboo sticky rice. Learn a few Khmer greetings.
  Don't take photos of people without permission, especially in rural villages.

Cambodia carries the weight of the Khmer Rouge era and the complexities of rapid development, but the people building lives here don't ask to be defined by that history. Farmers in Battambang province grow rice and raise families. Artists in Siem Reap train in classical dance traditions that survived near-extinction. In the forested hills of Mondulkiri, Bunong communities protect ancestral land and the wildlife that depends on it. The humor is sharp, the hospitality is generous, and the stories are told on the storytellers' own terms.
