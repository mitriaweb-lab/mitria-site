    description: In 2007, the Elephant Valley Project was launched as an elephant
      sanctuary developed to create a home for injured and overworked elephants
      and is now a centerpiece for elephant conservation, which is located
      within Putrom's community land. ELIE is unique in terms of its primary
      source of funding, which comes directly from donations made by local and
      international visitors to the EVP. Since 2006 the NGO has evolved and
      grown, with the development of the EVP as a tourist attraction, providing
      a sustainable financing mechanism for funding all ELIE programs.

  local foods like amok and bamboo sticky rice. Learn a few Khmer greetings.
  Don't take photos of people without permission, especially in rural villages.

In Cambodia, the sacred and the scarred walk side-by-side. Beneath the grandeur of Angkor's carved faces lies a deeper story of resilience: of farmers rebuilding livelihoods, artists reviving lost dances, and elders telling stories that were once almost silenced. From the rice paddies that stretch through the plains to the jungled hills of Mondulkiri that shelter rare wildlife and indigenous villages, the people here deal with trauma by cracking jokes and purveying a humbleness that borders on deprecation, but don't let the soft smiles fool you. Cambodians wear their history like a scar and a crown.
